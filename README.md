A Julia implementation of Rust's [array-linked-list](https://docs.rs/array-linked-list/latest/array_linked_list/index.html) library.

This code aims to be a translation of Rust's [array-linked-list](https://docs.rs/array-linked-list/latest/array_linked_list/index.html) to Julia, without introducing any new features at this stage.

As I am relatively new to Julia, I warmly welcome suggestions, contributions, and feedback from the community. Whether it's through pull requests or issue discussions, your input is valuable in making this toy project more useful.

## Quick Start

The code is currently under construction. You may not be able to use it now.

## Contributing

If you are interested in contributing, please feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

Your feedback is important! Please teach me how to use Julia.
